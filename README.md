# Polling-UI
I've created a simple, clean polling UI with the following features:
Key Features:

Clean, modern design with gradient background
Smooth animations when voting and showing results
Hover effects on poll options
Animated result bars that fill based on vote percentages
Vote counts displayed after voting
Total vote counter
Reset functionality to clear all votes
One vote per session limit

How it works:

Click any option to cast your vote
Results animate in with colored bars showing percentages
Vote counts and total votes appear
Use the reset button to clear everything and vote again

The design uses smooth CSS transitions and vanilla JavaScript for all interactions. No external dependencies - just simple, effective polling functionality!
